# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Code Review Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Validation Details**:
- Specification focuses on user workflows (reviewing code) without mentioning implementation technologies
- All 4 user stories have clear acceptance criteria with Given/When/Then format
- 15 functional requirements are testable and specific
- 7 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "within 10 seconds", "95% success rate")
- Edge cases cover git, API, and data size scenarios
- Assumptions section documents dependencies clearly
- Scope is bounded to code review functionality with 4 distinct review types
