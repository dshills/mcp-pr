# Tasks: MCP Code Review Server

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-write-an-mcp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle IV (TDD), tests MUST be written before implementation. Tests MUST fail initially, then pass after implementation (Red-Green-Refactor).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `cmd/`, `internal/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow the structure defined in plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Initialize Go module and directory structure

- [X] T001 Initialize Go module with `go mod init github.com/dshills/mcp-pr`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ MVP
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Adds git integration on top of US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Parallel to US2 (different git command)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Parallel to US2/US3

**Key Insight**: US2, US3, and US4 are independent (different git commands, same review engine) and can be developed in parallel after US1 is complete.

### Within Each User Story

- **Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation** (TDD requirement)
- Contract tests before integration tests
- Integration tests and unit tests can run in parallel (marked [P])
- All tests must pass before implementation begins
- Provider adapters can be implemented in parallel (marked [P])
- MCP tool handlers depend on underlying services (sequential)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T002-T006) can run in parallel after T001
- All Foundational model definitions (T009-T012) can run in parallel
- All provider adapters (T018-T020) can run in parallel within US1
- All tests marked [P] within a phase can run in parallel
- US2, US3, US4 can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all contract/integration tests for US1 together (TDD - ensure FAIL):
Task: "Contract test for MCP protocol compliance in tests/contract/mcp_protocol_test.go"
Task: "Contract test for Provider interface in tests/contract/provider_interface_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for Anthropic provider in tests/integration/anthropic_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for OpenAI provider in tests/integration/openai_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for Google provider in tests/integration/google_test.go"

# VERIFY TESTS FAIL, then launch all provider implementations together:
Task: "Implement Anthropic provider adapter in internal/providers/anthropic.go"
Task: "Implement OpenAI provider adapter in internal/providers/openai.go"
Task: "Implement Google provider adapter in internal/providers/google.go"

# VERIFY TESTS PASS, then continue with sequential dependencies
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

This delivers immediate value: arbitrary code review capability.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (pre-commit workflow)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (WIP feedback)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (historical audit)
6. Polish phase ‚Üí Final quality improvements

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (MVP - highest priority)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (staged review)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 OR 4 (unstaged/commit review)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Testing Requirements (Per Constitution Principle IV)

### TDD Workflow (MANDATORY)

1. Write tests FIRST for each user story
2. Run tests ‚Üí VERIFY THEY FAIL (Red)
3. Implement minimal code to make tests pass (Green)
4. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)
5. Repeat for next feature

### Test Coverage Targets

- **Contract tests**: MCP JSON-RPC compliance, provider interface contracts
- **Integration tests**: Live provider API calls (require API keys), git operations in temp repos
- **Unit tests**: Review engine logic, git client (mocked), MCP handlers
- **Coverage goal**: ‚â•80% per Constitution (run `go test -cover ./...`)

### Constitution Validation

Before marking implementation complete, verify:

- ‚úÖ All tests pass (`go test ./tests/...`)
- ‚úÖ Coverage ‚â•80%
- ‚úÖ `gofmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` pass
- ‚úÖ All exported functions have godoc comments
- ‚úÖ Structured logging (JSON) implemented for all operations
- ‚úÖ Provider interface properly abstracts all LLM integrations
- ‚úÖ MCP protocol compliance validated in contract tests

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **CRITICAL**: Verify tests FAIL before implementing (TDD Red-Green-Refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
