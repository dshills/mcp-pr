# Specification Quality Checklist: Project-Specific Environment Variables

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [specs/002-update-the-env/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Pass âœ…

All checklist items pass validation:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on "what" and "why" without implementation details. It describes the need for project-specific environment variables in terms of developer experience and avoiding namespace collisions, not specific code changes.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   - All 12 functional requirements are testable (can verify by checking environment variable names in code and documentation)
   - Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "100% of code references updated", "configuration loading completes without errors")
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on developer outcomes, not implementation)
   - Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format and are testable
   - Edge cases cover key scenarios (old variable names, both old and new set)
   - Scope is bounded with clear "Out of Scope" section
   - Dependencies and assumptions are documented

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to user stories and success criteria
   - Three user stories cover all aspects: namespace isolation (P1), API key compatibility (P1), documentation (P2)
   - Each user story is independently testable as specified
   - No implementation leakage (e.g., doesn't mention specific Go code structures, only file names in Dependencies)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- Backward compatibility requirement (FR-012) ensures smooth transition for existing users
- Clear prioritization allows phased implementation if needed
